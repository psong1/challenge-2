            <p class="summary">
                Before I decided to pursue a career as a full stack Engineer, I was on the path to becoming a physical therapist. 
                I graduated from the University of Georgia with a B.S. Ed in Exercise Science then started my experiential learning at Emory Healthcare.
                I have been challenged with many situations that I have had to adapt to, but this has helped me grow as a person.
