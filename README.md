# Personal Portfolio

## Description

This is my personal portfolio that will present my projects and evolving skillset to potential employers. It is a work in progress, and will be updated as I learn and practice more HTML, CSS, and Javascript. A practice project has been included as practice linking the repository.

## Projects

1. Codecademy Project: Dasmoto Arts
This is a beginner project that focuses on basic HTML syntax and CSS, including color and the box model.

* The rest of the project cards are placeholders and will be filled as projects are completed.
