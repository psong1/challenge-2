# Personal Portfolio

## Description

This is my personal portfolio that will present my projects and evolving skillset to potential employers. It is a work in progress, and will be updated as I learn and practice more HTML, CSS, and Javascript. A practice project has been included as practice linking the repository.

* The Javascript file was added to the repository and deployed, but won't show on deployed site. It does work when site is viewed on live server.
